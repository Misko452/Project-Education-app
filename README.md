# Project-Education-app

Application for teaching project work in school enviroment.

It works locally as a client, only requirements are .NET framework 6.0 for running an app (in case of an error, you will get link to website to download it but be careful on active directory networks and school networks with limited permition because it might need an administrator privileges to download the framework. 

Next you need your own FTP hosting and MSSQL server.

Once you have everything set, you need to add classes manually to database (admin app is not available in this version). After this step you are finally set to work on projects.

Note. Setup the app on storage with writing permissions, the application uses local .txt file to send off tasks formated as text and SWOT.
